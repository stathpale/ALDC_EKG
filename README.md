with Decision Regions
by Palaiologos Efstathios

C implementation

This implementation of the ALEKGC-DRalgorithm is part of an
already completed and evaluated study.

This version targets to demonstrate the benefits of the 
modifications that were applied to the basic ALDC algorithm 
in order to improve its overal performance when compressing
EKGs
